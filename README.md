Nasa Space Apps Challenge: Banana Rover


This project is solving the Lego Rovers challenge.

Enhancing Lego Rover with GPS and inertial navigation, with friendly control interface based on MAP. Real time 3D wireless streaming (eg.hdspa, wifi, etc), image analisys and pattern recognition.

We're heading to a seamless integration between the Lego NXT system and a powerful small board such as the Odroid to handle all the cpu-intensive stuff, like HD video streaming or pattern recognition (it also has built-in gps wich helps with rover navigation systems).

Our interface aims to control many-to-many, one-to-many and many-to-one (users and rovers).

We want the interface to be sleek and organized, having the behavior commands (such as the "IF...THEN" statements of the challenge) well set in a configuration panel, leaving the GUI to a "what the rover sees" view wich can be implemented also as stereoscopic 3D given the opportunity to add a couple of cameras to it.

We are open to collaborations from other teams around the world facing the same challenge.
